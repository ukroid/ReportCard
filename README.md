# ReportCard
I built a custom class (ReportCard.java) to construct a student's name and two grades into one unity.

In ReportCardActivity, the array ReportCard[] stores all the needed data. Tthen it's applied to the for() statement to enlist grades for each of a number of students.

The project idea is taken from the course Android Development for Beginners by Google on Udacity.
